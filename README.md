## Story Overview

In the shattered realm consumed by "The Verge"—a metaphysical corruption that feeds on memory and grief—you play as Thorne, a broken former knight. Years ago, his daughter Aila died in a horrific and unnatural way. Her death fractured his reality, and now echoes of her draw him into decaying landscapes both real and imagined.

As Thorne journeys through haunted remnants of the old world, he encounters manifestations of his past, including Kas Vire—his closest friend turned apostate philosopher. Together with spectral voices and shattered memories, Thorne searches for answers about Aila's death, the origin of the Verge, and his own role in the end of things.

Every fight, every whispered lie, and every step through collapsing memory spaces chips away at Thorne's sense of self—until you must choose: hold onto what's left, or let go completely.
