=========================================

What is LMMS?
------------
LMMS is a free, open-source Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) that was originally developed for Linux
but is now available across all major platforms (Windows, Mac, and Linux). It's similar in design and

6. Pattern-based workflow that's intuitive for beginners
7. Includes built-in synthesizers and effects
8. Supports MIDI input/output
9. Can export to various formats (including MIDI in newer versions)

Cons:
-----
1. Not updated frequently (last stable version 1.2.2 was released in 2020)
2. Limited VST plugin support
3. Not ideal for recording live instruments
4. Can be unstable with complex projects
5. Occasional crashes during import/export
6. Requires additional setup for MIDI sound fonts
7. Limited professional features compared to paid DAWs
